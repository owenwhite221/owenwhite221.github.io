          <h2>What is the Future After College</h2>

          <article>
            <p>Cadets who make it through the program (typically four years for a normal college student) will commission into the United States Air Force as a new second lieutenant. This means they are now an active duty Air Force officer that will eventually go to training for their selected job. </p>
            <p>Some jobs include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pilot</li>
                <li>Intelligence Officer</li>
                <li>Cyberspace Operations Officer</li>
                <li>Space Operations Officer</li>
                <li>Public Affairs Officer</li>
              </ul>
            <p>The reason why “pilot” does not have “officer” after it is because only officers can be pilots. The other jobs listed there have enlisted personnel that also perform in the same sector. But if you see a pilot, you automatically know they are an officer. So if you want to become a pilot, you must be an officer, and AFROTC is one way to do that. A pilot's commitment is ten years since the Air Force invests more time and money into your training.</p>
