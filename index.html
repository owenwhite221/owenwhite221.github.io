          <h2>What is Air Force ROTC?</h2>

          <article>
            <p>Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) is a leadership program on college campuses that builds new second lieutenants in the United States Air Force. Specifically located here at the University of Miami, is the AFROTC Detachment 155. A typical week is comprised of two physical training days and one leadership laboratory day. After completing the four year program, cadets will go into the United States Air Force and become everything from a pilot to an intelligence officer.

            <p>Field Training occurs over the summer.</p>
