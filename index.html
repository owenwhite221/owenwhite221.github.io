    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a senior at the University of Miami and this is my first time coding completely on my own. Not bad so far. It's actually pretty fun. I am studying electronic media and will graduate in May. After college I will join the Air Force and go to pilot training to eventually become an active duty pilot. I'm excited but also nervous. Either way I have loved my time and school so far and am trying to enjoy this last year.</p>
