          <h2>What is Air Force ROTC Leadership Laboratory?</h2>

          <article>
            <p>Many people who picture the military typically have people marching come into mind. Leadership Laboratory (LLAB) is where cadets will learn how to march and grasp Air Force customs and courtesies. LLAB is from 0630-0930 once a week. This is where upperclassmen put the underclassmen under pressure to teach them how to adapt and overcome difficult situations. </p>
            <p>Drill and marching is a very crucial part of LLAB that cadets must master since they must be organized and move in a cohesive unit. Thirty minutes on average per week is spent on marching and drill maneuvers. This skill not only applies in AFROTC and LLAB, but once cadets commission and are a part of the active duty Air Force, they are expected to know how to march.</p>
